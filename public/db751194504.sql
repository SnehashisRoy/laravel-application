WordPress 5.0, codenamed Gutenberg, is one of the largest changes we&#8217;ve seen to the actual dashboard interface in a while.

The idea is to bring content creation to the masses, allowing those without coding know-how to publish beautiful websites.</p>\n<p>While in theory, this is an exciting update to WordPress, a CMS that populates more than 30% of the entire web, there are some considerations that need to be made before jumping to hit that &#8216;upgrade&#8217; button on your site. Because Gutenberg is such a drastic departure from the TinyMCE editor we&#8217;ve grown to know and love, the latest forum activity has shown it to be significantly more &#8216;buggy&#8217; than previous versions. There are also numerous articles outlining how much more cumbersome certain actions are now &#8211; what used to be a simple line of code now requires numerous clicks to achieve.</p>\n<p>The biggest issue arising is not with new sites, rather with older sites that are attempting to upgrade to Gutenberg. The WordPress plugin community is vast, and attempting to reduce plugin conflict has been a rocky road. Many users are finding their sites &#8216;broken&#8217; after the update because the plugins that they are using are not compatible with Gutenberg.</p>\n<p>Johannes Gensfleisch zur Laden zum Gutenberg may have been the original content publisher, but I&#8217;d guess even he would hold off on updating his site. I&#8217;m not questioning that the future could be grand for Gutenberg, I&#8217;m just cautioning that we may not be quite there yet.</p>\n', '<p>The latest WordPress release is set to hit the shelves this week and there&#8217;s been a lot of buzz in the community surrounding it.

With that said, there is a time and place for using a free or cheap online logo generator, and we’ll explain when it’s a good idea and when it’s not.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Here’s the part where we tell you when it’s not.</span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h4><strong>1. The will logo design suck</strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br />\n</span></h4>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You get what you pay for. Free logo design or even cheap logo design always equals bad logo design. What do we mean by bad?</span></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Unoriginal work. You run the risk of seeing your precious logo slapped on someone else&#8217;s website.</li>\n<li>Did we say unoriginal work? Lot&#8217;s of designers will take existing designs from stock websites, tweak a few things and call it a day.</li>\n<li>Overall poor quality. It&#8217;s commonplace for designers to hand off files that are grainy or maybe the linework sucks, or perhaps the typography looks like it came from the 90s.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h4><strong>2. You’ll waste your time</strong></h4>\n<p>This by far is the most important takeaway. By the time you&#8217;ve pitched your design, interviewed candidates, corresponded with the designer (they oftentimes aren&#8217;t even in the same timezone as you), and go back and forth with edits, you’ll wish you hadn’t. If time is money, you’ll be spending more in the project management  than you would have if you just went with an agency.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h4><strong>3. You&#8217;ll waste your money</strong></h4>\n<p>There has been countless stories about people spending $100 and ending up with nothing. Zero. Just google, &#8220;Fiverr Logo here&#8217;s what happened&#8221;. You&#8217;ll see results like &#8220;$5 logo? Is this a joke?&#8221; What tends to happen is clients will be unsatisfied with the work provided and request more iterations which means forking up more money. By the time most people reach the $100 mark, they just abandon ship.</p>\n<p>Here&#8217;s when it&#8217;s okay to use Fiverr or an online logo maker.</p>\n<p>You must be all of these things in order to get a good experience when using Fiverr:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Uninvested in the project (maybe the logo is for a &#8216;just for fun event&#8217; DO NOT use this for a business you want to invest time into).</li>\n<li>Unbothered by a drawn out timeline (you can spare a few weeks to get the final artwork).</li>\n<li>Unpicky (Not a word, but we had a theme going).</li>\n</ul>\n<p>So let&#8217;s say you&#8217;re the opposite. You want a great logo and you want it quickly.</p>\n<p><em>*Cue shameless plug*</em></p>\n<p>No, you don&#8217;t have to run to a top marketing agency that will charge you 20k. There&#8217;s a happy medium.</p>\n<p>Working with a boutique full-service agency is a good call for many reasons. Firstly, you&#8217;ll get focused attention to reach your business objectives instead of cookie cutter solutions. Secondly, we say &#8216;full service&#8217; because chances are if you&#8217;re needing a logo design, you&#8217;re needing more services as well.

Many Silicon Valley ex-pats that have moved back to the Midwest have brought with them their own brand of tech. Fewer entrepreneurs of the Midwest are focused on modern convenience apps for young urban dwellers and instead are taking on difficult problems for the region’s established industries.

In addition, a firewall can prevent comment spamming on your blog &#8211; saving you the trouble of deleting all those unwelcome posts.  There are many companies that can provide a firewall &#8211; just to name a few: Cloudflare along with its CDN (Content Delivery Network), and Sitelock.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-3339\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/leverage.it/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/best-firewalls-for-windows-screenager-JsHQcn-clipart.png?resize=424%2C264&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"use-firewall-protect-website\" width=\"424\" height=\"264\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/leverage.it/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/best-firewalls-for-windows-screenager-JsHQcn-clipart.png?w=577&amp;ssl=1 577w, https://i2.wp.com/leverage.it/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/best-firewalls-for-windows-screenager-JsHQcn-clipart.png?resize=300%2C187&amp;ssl=1 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 424px) 100vw, 424px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></span></p>\n<h3><b>3) Keep your systems current</b></h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Not only is it tedious, but it can be a major headache to update all applications your site might be using. That includes your CMS (i.e. WordPress) and all plugins, add-ons, etc. However, why is it strongly recommended? Here&#8217;s an example: a hacker manages to find a security loop in a plugin on your site which allows them to target your visitors. Meanwhile, an innocent user is attempting to make a donation to their favourite cause, and unknowingly sends money straight to the hacker&#8217;s bank account in Guatemala. By updating WordPress and plugins (or any other systems you might be using), you will minimize the risks caused to your site and site visitors.</span></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/leverage.it/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/maxresdefault-2.jpg?ssl=1\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-3341\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/leverage.it/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/maxresdefault-2.jpg?resize=389%2C257&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"protect your site\" width=\"389\" height=\"257\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/leverage.it/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/maxresdefault-2.jpg?w=2298&amp;ssl=1 2298w, https://i0.wp.com/leverage.it/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/maxresdefault-2.jpg?resize=300%2C199&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/leverage.it/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/maxresdefault-2.jpg?resize=1024%2C678&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/leverage.it/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/maxresdefault-2.jpg?resize=1920%2C1271&amp;ssl=1 1920w, https://i0.wp.com/leverage.it/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/maxresdefault-2.jpg?w=2160&amp;ssl=1 2160w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 389px) 100vw, 389px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></a></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">These are a few tips to move your business or organization towards PCI Compliance.

If your business makes products, a “buy one and get the second set 50% off” promo would work well. Choose a call-to-action that allows people to learn more about the promotion, whether that’s a link to your website or a phone number to call. </span></p>\n<h3><b>Announcements</b></h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Perhaps your business is opening a new location. Attract some attention through your Google listing “New Location Celebration” and invite people to a party!

Without doing your homework, you’ll be pouring money and time into an app which might be mining nothing but rocks.</p>\n<h4><b><b>Think: Why Choose Me?</b></b></h4>\n<p>The first stage in figuring out the value of your app is to learn why people would use it. Start by thinking about what people would gain from your app in terms of time, functionality or financially.</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Knowing what your customer lacks helps you better tweak your app to suit their needs. Also, it will help your marketing efforts later on when you need to identify your Target Audience.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ask yourself: </span></p>\n<ol>\n<ol>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“What problem am I addressing with my app?”</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Is my app providing a unique experience that cannot be gotten elsewhere?”</span></li>\n</ol>\n</ol>\n<h4>Speak: Would You Choose Me?</h4>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While you might think you know what needs your app fulfills, chances are they aren’t even aware that they need anything. </span></p>\n<blockquote><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The best marketing is showing a customer why they </span><b><i>need</i></b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> you.</span></p></blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Have you ever thought about a new technology or product and thought “how did I ever live without it?” If so, you now know how your app has to make people feel.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Without diligent research, you will never know if your app will take off. Getting feedback on your idea from real, unbiased people (your Mom and BFF don’t count) will allow you to learn what bothers your potential client base and improve the final product.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Remember to keep an open mind when collecting data you might find yourself with a totally different (and better-selling) app in the end!</span></p>\n<h4><b><b>Act: Choose Me!</b></b></h4>\n<p>Now let’s get down to business. Test it.</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Create a Beta version of your app and send it to as many people as possible. Give your guinea pigs some time to use it and then gather feedback; does it need more tweaking?

I’m a graphic designer fresh out of school and I love web design and branding.</p>\n<p>It has been a month since I began my internship at LeverageIT and within those 4 weeks, I’ve learned quite a bit and I know there’s still so much more for me to learn and I cannot wait. The Humber College Graphic Design program is 3 years, that including a summer internship that helps you get work experience. The summer internship portion is what I’m currently doing. This industry is extremely competitive so it only seems natural now that I would feel scared, nervous, happy and excited all at the same time.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>HOW I GOT MY INTERNSHIP</strong></p>\n<p>At the end of the semester, a majority of the design programs have a portfolio night, attended by industry, friends, and family. It&#8217;s a great opportunity to get feedback on your portfolio. This is and was our night to shine, because what better way to find a job than to actually talk to the person that is able to hire you.</p>\n<p>This is where I met Ali. <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Al</span>i is LeverageIT’s creative director and my mentor. Upon meeting him, I was immediately appreciative of him. We went through my portfolio together and he told me what he liked and what he didn’t. Ali who is experienced with website and UI/UX design, gave me a lot of feedback that I did not previously consider. Going to school, I had a big interest in web and app design, but I was unable to receive qualified feedback on my work from someone who is actually experienced in this field until I met Ali.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>MY INTERNSHIP</strong></p>\n<p><strong>The Start</strong></p>\n<p>Coming in, I was extremely excited but at the same time, I had knots in my stomach. I was nervous for many reasons but mainly about making mistakes and fear of not being <em>good enough</em>. I was more excited than nervous but the two emotions would often compete. was excited that I found a digital agency that without me knowing, checked off the things on my list that I was looking for.</p>\n<p>What I Wanted vs What They Offered</p>\n<p>• I have such a big love and interest for <strong>web design</strong> and at LeverageIT this is what they do.</p>\n<p>• I actually never considered <strong>marketing</strong> before but it ended up being something I quite enjoyed after working on a few projects here that involve it.</p>\n<p>• I work with a lot of <strong>developers</strong> and it’s really cool to see a design being brought to life.</p>\n<p>• Free <strong><em>coffee</em></strong>. I think this one is self explanatory, free coffee is the best type of coffee.</p>\n<p>• LeverageIT is such a <strong>welcoming environment</strong> to work in. Working in an environment like this only makes me want to work harder to keep everyone and myself happy.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>The Process<br />\n</strong>As an intern, I find it quite challenging. There’s a lot to learn in a short amount of time and expectations are high. There are so many designers who could have applied and I got it. This is my chance to prove myself. I’m constantly thinking to myself if what I’m doing is okay, are they happy? Do they like it? What can I improve on? What else can I do? Am I doing enough? What do I do if they don’t like it? So many questions ripping through my mind. And… it’s okay to have questions and especially to ask questions. It’s better to ask questions so both yourself and whoever you’re working with is on the same page. When assuming everything could go wrong and a lot of time can be wasted. The people you work with will most likely be very happy to help you out.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>The End<br />\n</strong>Your internship is a great opportunity for you to learn. It’s the best time because you’re not quite a full-time member but you’re not a student either. You’re not treated like a student but you’re still learning and being taught. You’re not just there to learn, you are there to improve and gain experience. You might find that you really enjoy doing something you didn’t consider but took on the challenge anyways. Going into my internship, I’ve learned a lot and have become so much more curious. I’ve found an interest and liking for marketing, coding and development.  It’s a constant learning process that should never end because you won’t grow as a designer or person. It’s not about perfection but more of your progression. Something I took away at my interview is “have a curious mind.” And even the board room was saying it to my face “Stay hungry, stay foolish” Always wanting to learn and explore is a good mindset to have.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n', '<p>Before I jump into my internship, I just wanted to quickly introduce myself.

So how do you create a new brand that can stand out from the noise?</p>\n<p>That was the challenge we faced when Samuel Werner approached us with his idea for a new high-end mens socks collection: <a href=\"http://aristocratsocks.com/\">Aristocrat Socks</a>. Mr. Werner had a look and feel in mind&#8211;he wanted it to be luxurious yet still affordable. His family&#8217;s history in producing top quality garments, meant access to the best materials and production facilities.

However, digital marketing is vast and covers many things, with innovations happening daily. As with most business activities, it is important to measure the success of any digital marketing efforts you take on. For some, this comes easy but for others it can be a little harder and overwhelming. In a series of blog posts, I’ll explain the most commonly confused metrics to help you decide whether or not they’ll work toward achieving your business goals. </span></p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\"><b>Impressions</b></span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\"><b>Basic Definition:</b> The total number of times your ads show.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">  </span>This might be as images on the side or top of a website if you pay for display advertising, or as paid search results using AdWords.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\"><b>Does It Matter:</b> If your business goal is brand awareness, you&#8217;ll want your ads to show up for potential customers as many times and places as possible. Think of it as passing out flyers downtown. The to ask yourself is what you will gain from your ad showing more. Are your ads frequent and pervasive enough to be memorable? How will this brand awareness affect your revenue? Although you are paying for a large number of impressions, viewers may not be clicking or taking action based on your ads. </span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">The form of advertising used may also determine the number of impressions your ads will get. If your advertising plan is &#8220;pay-per-click,&#8221; your daily/monthly budget may be reached with fewer impressions if you have a high clickthrough rate, but have the same effect on your ROI than if it took more impressions to get the same clicks. </span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Here’s an example:</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Imagine your monthly PPC is $1,000. Each of your clicks costs $1, so you can afford 1,000 clicks per month. </span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">In March, 5 out of every 100 people that saw your ad and clicked on it. This means that you totalled 20,000 impressions.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">In April, you improved your ad and now 20 out of 100 people click on it. Your total number of impressions for this month was &#8220;only&#8221; 5,000.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Even though your number of impressions dropped by 75% (20,000 to 5,000) in the span of one month, the net result to your business is the exact same, because it resulted in the same number of clicks.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Depending on your objectives there can be an issue of having too few impressions. You might expect that your ads will be clicked on X many times producing X amount of revenue, but if they don&#8217;t show to enough people, this will take longer than expected. </span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Let&#8217;s say you operate in a niche industry, selling only green Mickey Mouse watches in Cincinnati, Ohio. Imagine that you&#8217;ve hired an AdWords manager to bring clicks to your e-commerce website. It’s likely that very few people in Cincinnati are searching Google for green Mickey Mouse watches, so your ads will likely not show very often. Since people won’t see your ad there will be very low amount of clicks. </span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Many advertising services offer pay-per-impression plans (PPM), and it&#8217;s important to know that it&#8217;s quite possible that your expenses are being measured using a &#8220;metric&#8221; that is not directly related to your revenue stream. In other words, your expenses are being measured based on the first step in the purchase process (awareness), and not allowing you to properly gage how they relate to the last step of the process (buying decision).</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Keep an eye out for more posts around the key digital marketing metrics your business needs to know and measure.</p>\n', '<p>If your small business has a website, you&#8217;re probably already paying someone to do your digital marketing.

Some businesses have relatively straightforward goals online, for example if a business can sell online then a simple CTA to &#8216;buy&#8217; is required and the path to a conversion is pretty clear. Others have conversions that cannot be made online for one reason or another, they may not be able to sell online, or they&#8217;re not a B2C business, or their target audience is hard to reach online. Despite the inability to sell online, these businesses realize the other benefits of being online, e.g. increasing brand awareness, staying top-of-mind with their potential and prospective customers, keeping up (and surpassing) the competition, understanding current trends, providing information to customers, preparing customers for purchase and more. The customized CTA&#8217;s now provided by various social media ads platforms allow for more flexibility with ads, granting a wider variety of businesses the opportunity to create effective ads.</p>\n<p><strong>Twitter</strong> &#8211; can create campaigns around: increasing followers, tweet engagement, website clicks (or conversions), app installs or re-engagements, leads, video views, and custom campaigns.</p>\n<p><strong>Facebook</strong> &#8211; Boost your posts, promote your page, website clicks, website conversions, installs of app, app engagements, local ads (around a physical location), event ads, offer ads, and video views.</p>\n<p><strong>Instagram</strong> &#8211; Boost your posts, website clicks, website conversions, installs of app, app engagements, and video views.</p>\n<h4>Live streaming</h4>\n<p>Periscope has been named <a href=\"http://smallbiztrends.com/2015/12/periscope-named-app-year-small-business-headlines.html\">&#8216;App of the Year&#8217; by Apple</a>, Meerkat received more than 200,000 mentions on Twitter this March, and <a href=\"http://newsroom.fb.com/news/2015/12/introducing-live-video-and-collages/\">Facebook began rolling out live videos</a> to US users this month. It seems safe to say that live streaming is here to stay.</p>\n<h4>Sharing economy</h4>\n<p>The success of <a href=\"https://www.uber.com/\">Uber</a> and <a href=\"https://www.airbnb.com/\">Airbnb</a> has encouraged entrepreneurs around the globe to apply the shared-economy model to their own businesses. The sharing economy model is based on using technology to allow users to exchange goods and services amongst each other. It&#8217;s disrupting industries left and right, in <a href=\"http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/toronto/3-things-to-know-about-toronto-city-council-s-uber-vote-1.3249187\">Toronto, city councillors are deciding</a> the operation of Uber in the city, while condo boards are struggling to figure out the <a href=\"http://www.theglobeandmail.com/life/home-and-garden/real-estate/toronto-condo-owners-warned-over-short-term-rentals/article23761219/\">legality of Airbnb</a>. Still, these growing pains, have not dissuaded excited entrepreneurs who are rising to the challenge of bringing the sharing economy to their industry. We had the pleasure of working with <a href=\"https://www.google.ca/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=1&amp;cad=rja&amp;uact=8&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiI0_qJv5DKAhWHKh4KHYExCK0QFggcMAA&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.linkedin.com%2Fin%2Fbenzlotnick&amp;usg=AFQjCNGRn5JRawM4Qov6SlGwFQhn96DW0A\">Ben Zlotnick</a> of <a href=\"http://adenearthworks.com\">Aden Earthworks</a> and <a href=\"http://incubes.ca/\">Incubes</a>, to develop <a href=\"http://edenapp.com/\">Eden</a>, an on-demand app for landscaping and snow removal.</p>\n<h4>Educational, funny, or shocking content</h4>\n<p>We no longer need to sell the importance of content, in the last few years most businesses realized that content vs. hard advertising/selling is the way to capture an audience&#8217;s attention. The content has to be engaging (and sometimes promoted) to get in front of users, or it should offer value, e.g. information, answers, solutions, or directions.  If your content is not providing one of these key service to your audience, it&#8217;s unlikely it&#8217;ll get much attention.</p>\n<h4>User-generated (&amp; up-voted) content</h4>\n<p>What&#8217;s so great about user-generated content? It&#8217;s authentic, human, and relatable. It may not always be high-quality, but it fosters a sense of community with its recipient, which is pretty special. We do not see this trend slowing down any time soon, take a look at the growth of Reddit communities in the last few years.</p>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/d28wbuch0jlv7v.cloudfront.net/images/infografik/normal/chartoftheday_3623_reddit_growth_n.jpg?resize=960%2C684&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" width=\"960\" height=\"684\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></p>\n<h4>Facebook&#8217;s changing role</h4>\n<p>When was the last time you saw someone upload an album to Facebook? Probably quite a while ago. Facebook is no longer the network it once was. Today it&#8217;s easier to learn what&#8217;s going on the other side of the world through Facebook rather than what&#8217;s happening with your friends and family. This media-fication of Facebook was, of course, Mark Zuckerberg&#8217;s goal all along in making Facebook everyone&#8217;s personal newspaper. But do young people <strong>want</strong> a personal newspaper? Do users <strong>want</strong> a newspaper that&#8217;s curated by Facebook&#8217;s algorithms?</p>\n<h4>A more sophisticated and lazy internet user</h4>\n<p>So hopefully by this point you&#8217;ve explain to your dad, grandma or gullible friend that there is no Nigerian prince that will send them copious amounts of money online, the concept of clickbait, the importance of privacy online, and the slim chance anyone is making $3000 cash a week online. As internet users spend more time online interacting with different types of content, they learn what kind of content is good and which to avoid. This familiarity with content types and new content formats has negative effects too, people rely increasingly on article titles and summaries, and less on reading complete articles. The issue with this is the internet user becomes lazier in a sense, and less likely to click through to a piece of content. This may seem disadvantageous at first, but it could work to your advantage if you place the most important messaging in your title and summary.</p>\n<p>We look forward to keeping a close eye on new and evolving trends in 2016, integrating and applying them to your business goals.</p>\n', '<p>With 2015 behind the corner now, we figured we&#8217;d review some of the top trends digital marketing trends we saw throughout the past year, ones that we feel will be important in 2016 too. Without further ado, here they are: Customized Calls-to-actions As an increasing number of businesses are coming online, a larger variety of calls-to-actions is required [&hellip;]</p>\n', 2958, '2019-04-11 02:14:21', '2019-04-26 01:14:37', '2019-04-26 01:14:37'),

They&#8217;re the link that collects information about visitors and traffic and turns them into prospects and leads. Though the goal behind landing pages may differ depending on your business, e.g. ecommerce vs. in-store purchase, the elements for an engaging landing page that drives people to take a valuable business action remain pretty consistent. Feel free to use the 10 key points we list below as a check-list to ensure your landing pages are well-built.</p>\n<p><!--more--></p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<h4>Have an objective in mind</h4>\n<p>Your landing page should be built around a key objective, e.g. do you want this visitor to sign up for your newsletter? Would you like them to request a quote for your services? This is the key point to keep in mind while adding any elements to your page, remember to keep things simple and if you feel that a certain line of text takes away from the objective, then consider removing it instead of cluttering up important space.</li>\n<li>\n<h4>Grab their attention</h4>\n<p>Your landing page should be clear and relatively concise, but it should also be attractive, utilizing elements of design to allow a visitor to follow a logical path with the end-goal of driving a call-to-action. Here are <a href=\"http://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/landing-page-examples-list\">8 great landing page designs curated by Hubspot</a>.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i1.wp.com/leverage.it/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/customer-journey1.png\"><img class=\"wp-image-2310 size-large aligncenter\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/leverage.it/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/customer-journey1-1024x577.png?resize=1024%2C577\" alt=\"customer journey1\" width=\"1024\" height=\"577\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></a></li>\n<li>\n<h4>Stay true to your brand</h4>\n<p>Ensure that the design of the landing page matches the rest of your site, don&#8217;t turn your landing page into a microsite that confuses the visitor. Keep in mind the customer journey your visitor may take, e.g. seeing a social media post, visiting your site, moving through various pages and arriving at your landing page &#8211; and ensure that the experience is seamless and consistent.</li>\n<li>\n<h4>Think through the customer journey</h4>\n<p>As mentioned above, you want to really think through your customer journey. How will people arrive at this landing page? Will they come here from an online ad and therefore have certain expectations about what they find? Are you ensuring that you meet those expectations? Will they arrive at this page after browsing through your site? These are all important points to consider when building your landing page, you may require various landing pages based on different customer journeys. If you&#8217;re working on your &#8216;request a quote&#8217; landing page and its linked to from your product pages, then you won&#8217;t need to make that landing page discuss product info in detail or you may be repeating a lot of the info they just read on your product pages.</li>\n<li>\n<h4>Build trust and confidence</h4>\n<p>Including testimonials, customer quotes, positive reviews, etc. is a great way to minimize a visitor&#8217;s hesitation about going through with the CTA on your landing page.</li>\n<li>\n<h4>Have a clear call-to-action</h4>\n<p>Keeping your objective in mind, create a clear flow in your landing page, basing it around a single customer action that you want a visitor to complete before they leave your page. Not sure how to phrase yours? Here are <a href=\"http://cdn2.hubspot.net/hub/53/file-13222290-pdf/docs/ebooks/original%20files/hbebook20120307.pdf\">101 examples of call-to-actions.</a></li>\n<li>\n<h4>Give incentive for visitors to preform the CTA</h4>\n<p>Your product or services are great on their own and you will effectively communicate this by listing their benefits, but it never hurts to throw in a little something extra to increase conversions. Are you looking to increase email sign-ups? Offer a discount off on your products, or a freebee when they preform the desired action. Many companies will offer a free trial, e-book, webinar, contest entry, etc. in exchange for a prospect&#8217;s information.</li>\n<li>\n<h4>Measure and optimize</h4>\n<p>Make sure that you&#8217;re effectively tracking your conversions once your landing page is live.

It&#8217;s important not to focus too much on device, content must be easily accessible via various devices but don&#8217;t overlook the actual content and user &#8211; remember that at the end of the day, you&#8217;re developing content for people, not their devices.</p>\n<h4>4 audience parameters to keep in mind</h4>\n<p>A deep consideration of your audience. The presentation looks into several current realities of the consumer: time (content was developed for someone for a particular moment in time), activities (developed around what they&#8217;re doing in that moment), IQ/EQ (developed to meet their emotional and intellectual IQ), and behaviours (developed based on their behaviours). &#8211; As marketers we should be thinking about these parameters when developing content, try and apply these to your buyer persona and create content around them.</p>\n<h4>Plagiarizing from a plagiarizer?</h4>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/leverage.it/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/Leverage_buzzfeed.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-2357\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/leverage.it/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/Leverage_buzzfeed-1024x295.jpg?resize=1024%2C295\" alt=\"Leverage_buzzfeed\" width=\"1024\" height=\"295\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></a></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Looking to <a href=\"http://www.buzzfeed.com/\">Buzzfeed</a> for inspiration. Now, I am not a big buzzfeed fan, in my opinion they just <a href=\"http://www.thewire.com/business/2013/03/buzzfeeds-happiest-facts-all-time-were-mostly-plagiarized-reddit/62918/\">recycle stale content from Reddit </a>and lack any originality, that being said, the content on Reddit is often great but not easily accessible to many. So, what Buzzfeed did was ingenious is a way; they took Reddit&#8217;s (<a href=\"http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2014/09/benny-johnson-hired-by-national-review.html\">and others&#8217;</a>) content and made it accessible (turning it into lists, galleries) instead of Reddit&#8217;s forum format. The result? Viral content. Of course the content is often not Buzzfeed&#8217;s, but then again, it&#8217;s not really Reddit&#8217;s either, it&#8217;s their community&#8217;s; they&#8217;re the ones who upvote, troll, and comment. I had a chance to ask Reddit co-founder <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexis_Ohanian\">Alex Ohanian</a> what he thought about the blatant stealing of content ideas, and <a href=\"http://live.fastcompany.com/Event/Chat_with_reddit_co-founder_Alexis_Ohanian/92395947\">he didn&#8217;t seem to mind much</a>.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><iframe style=\"border: 1px solid #CCC; border-width: 1px; margin-bottom: 5px; max-width: 100%;\" src=\"//www.slideshare.net/slideshow/embed_code/38981379\" width=\"597\" height=\"486\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"> </iframe></p>\n<p><strong><a title=\"Growing Audience For Newspapers - ASNE/ APME Conference 2014\" href=\"https://www.slideshare.net/webbmedia/growing-audience-for-newspapers-asne-apme-conference-2014\" target=\"_blank\">Growing Audience For Newspapers &#8211; ASNE/ APME Conference 2014</a> </strong> from <strong><a href=\"http://www.slideshare.net/webbmedia\" target=\"_blank\">Webbmedia Group</a></strong></p>\n<p>Hopefully you&#8217;ve found some valuable lessons and commonalities between the problems journalists and editors face, and those we marketers face.

Just make sure to pay close attention to how it renders on various devices and browsers by sending out a few tests.</p>\n<h2>Reach</h2>\n<p>I am a huge fan of social media marketing, but the reach you have with those networks can be deceiving, e.g. <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/marketing/posts/10150839503836337\">the organic reach you have by sharing something with your own fans on Facebook is only 16%</a>, in order to reach the rest you&#8217;ll have to promote those posts at extra cost. With email, you will have the potential to reach everyone who receives your email at no extra cost.</p>\n<h2>Tracking</h2>\n<p>There are <a href=\"http://mailchimp.com/\">entire companies whose sole purpose is to ensure your email marketing is effective</a>, so they&#8217;ve created pretty elaborate tracking tools. In addition, there are <a href=\"http://mailchimp.com/resources/research/email-marketing-benchmarks/\">many stats out there on various industries</a>, which you can use as benchmarks in your campaigns&#8217; performances. <img class=\"wp-image-1971 size-large aligncenter\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/leverage.it/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/7-insightful-email-marketing-stats-for-small-businesses.jpg?w=100%25\" alt=\"7 insightful email marketing stats for small businesses\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" />   Are you currently doing email marketing?

If you coded PHP five or even ten years ago and know the basics of object oriented programming then you will still be able to read and write PHP code today. Even when a new branch is released, the adoption rate is very slow and developers are reluctant to use new features since their code won&#8217;t be portable if moved to an older shared server using an older version of PHP.</div>\n<div></div>\n<p><!--more--></p>\n<div></div>\n<div>However, unlike .NET and Ruby on Rails, PHP is just a language and not a complete framework. Although PHP alone will suffice for small sites that require minimal PHP code and are mostly HTML, when you start building medium to large scale projects you really need to use a framework. A Model View Controller (MVC) Framework will keep your code organized and divided and will allow you to re-use code in the framework for common tasks shared between most typical web projects (login, roles and permissions, forms, grids etc&#8230;). The question every new PHP developer asks is &#8220;what framework should I learn?&#8221;</div>\n<div></div>\n<h2>So what framework should you learn?</h2>\n<div>My First introduction to the MVC paradigm was through Zend, one of the oldest and heavily used PHP Frameworks. I didnt have a choice since I was taking over a project from an Indian team and learned a lot about the framework from learning their code which I had to work on. Zend, like older frameworks is somewhat bloated and slow. It tries to get involved in every aspect of your website (zend buttons, zend forms etc&#8230;). With older mature frameworks like Zend and Symfony2, even a simple Hello World page has a lag due to the overhead of the framework. The upside is that these two beasts have been around for a while, have a stable and robust code base and a huge community.</div>\n<div></div>\n<div>\n<div style=\"width: 592px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img src=\"https://ci5.googleusercontent.com/proxy/ilf6FNAqq8tAohCzE8orO0fGRHS_83Pdo6Ug21xE-c88oXnRymCAG469cRtu__Hv_6ecgo5Ca4ttb8PltRCFD8negj9JHo3Z53beR9X0H1UnZ9jwz8ejdoy0gfnht5vYaLY=s0-d-e1-ft#http://www.highnd.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/php-frameworks-websites.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"582\" height=\"220\" /><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Zend drop off</p></div>\n</div>\n<div></div>\n<div>I was tasked with starting a new large scale project about two years ago and did some serious research into PHP frameworks at the time. I chose to go with Yii, it was very popular, brand new, <a href=\"http://www.yiiframework.com/performance/\">fast</a> and cool. It came with code that would pre-build your models from a database schema including foreign relations which work with Yii&#8217;s active records. Im still working on this project today and have been happy with the framework, however, as time passed, so did the fad. Newer cooler and faster frameworks came out and the Yii community went down to 7.6% of PHP projects (see graph below for popularity of various PHP networks).</div>\n<div></div>\n<div><a href=\"https://i1.wp.com/leverage.it/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/framework-popularity-PHP-leaverageIT.png\"><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-1951 size-square-image\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/leverage.it/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/framework-popularity-PHP-leaverageIT-600x600.png?resize=600%2C600\" alt=\"framework popularity PHP - leaverageIT\" width=\"600\" height=\"600\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></a></div>\n<div></div>\n<div>When starting my next large project should I jump on the bandwagon and start learning Laravel or Phalcon or continue with Yii or Zend? Once Yii2 or another new framework comes out, support for Laravel and Phalcon will go down as new developers look for the latest and coolest. Furthermore, new frameworks may not have stable code nor a lot of help forums to research issues. There is a steep learning curve in tackling a new framework and it&#8217;s not worth it for just one project if you know another framework better.</div>\n<div></div>\n<div></div>\n<div>In conclusion, most of the MVC frameworks available today are more or less the same. They provide a secure skeleton that forces you to keep your code organized and can speed up development if you know the syntax well. Once you have learned a framework well, stick with it! Join communities, help out beginners and even consider contributing to its code base or reporting bugs. Like a programming language, the issue is less about which one you choose and more about how you use it. Don&#8217;t take shortcuts or hack the framework, use it as it was meant to be used</div>\n<div></div>\n<div></div>\n<div>Do you need help with your development needs? <a href=\"http://leverage.it/contact-2/\">Contact us today</a>.</div>\n', '<p>PHP, much like most programming languages is very slow to evolve.

We’re so accustomed to using these services on a daily basis, that we rarely stop to think about the great “kindness” the Google gives us every day.</p>\n<p><!--more--></p>\n<p>The extremely broad question at hand is about the extent by which Google shapes the way we use the Internet, therefore potentially affecting the decisions that we make.</p>\n<p>However, this isn’t a philosophical essay on the terrible large multinational corporations that control our lives and store our most sensitive personal data.</p>\n<p>This is an article about how you, a business owner, can utilize this for your own gain.</p>\n<p>And of course, how <a href=\"http://leverage.it/\">LeverageIT</a> can help you get there.</p>\n<h2>Google: Organizing the World&#8217;s Information</h2>\n<p>Google has two major functions, the first of which is to make sure that you keep using its services for everything you need. The more synonymous it becomes with the Internet, the less of a chance there exists the possibility of you switching to one of their few competitors. For now, you have parody videos like this one to show the current state of searching online:</p>\n<p><iframe src=\"//www.youtube.com/embed/tYVCk10AzS0\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"></iframe></p>\n<h2>Google: $60 Billion in Revenue</h2>\n<p>The second function is to make some cash to pay their kids through college.</p>\n<p>That’s why, when I speak to clients about running Google AdWords for their business, I’m often disappointed at the current performance of their accounts. Tens to hundreds of thousands of dollars of annual spending are being wasted by managers who think that working with Google is as easy as using its search engine.</p>\n<p>This is where Google’s two major functions come back in. Google needs to maintain its set of standards each time someone uses their search engine. They don’t want people to search for “coffee beans” and get advertisements for “real estate.” If that were to happen, Google would lose the reputation that it has worked so hard to build up, and then you may even stop referring to Googling for information as “Googling,” and you may call it “searching.” It’s a scary thought, indeed.</p>\n<p>That’s why, you shouldn’t be shocked that you’re being over-charged for your sub-par ad, or if Google assesses it with such a low “quality score,” that it doesn’t even want to display it.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">The second function of Google explains why they aren’t exactly helping you out. They constantly create new ways for AdWords account managers to have a more difficult time correctly utilizing their marketing dollars by making it difficult for them to figure out why their revenue hasn’t gone up this quarter. And then, once managers do begin to discover ways to improve your account, Google catches on, and then changes settings to either make it impossible to fit Google’s own standards at a low cost, or makes it so time-consuming for the average business owner, that they grow accustomed to wasting large percentages of their budgets.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Google essentially filters out the good from the bad, and then somehow profits even more from the bad. </span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">At LeverageIT, we dedicate our time to making the most of your ad spending.

It&#8217;s a neurodegenerative disease characterized by a rapidly progressive weakness, as well as difficulty in speaking, swallowing, and breathing.</p>\n<p>The campaign was put together to raise money and awareness for ALSA &#8211; the ALS association. And saying the campaign is a success would be a grave understatement, the campaign has raised an unprecedented amount of money for the disorder &#8211; <a href=\"http://www.alsa.org/news/media/press-releases/ice-bucket-challenge-0818.html\">surpassing $15 million today</a>. The awareness raised by it is hard to calculate, but it&#8217;s safe to say that it&#8217;s likely surpassed a hundred million if we add up all the fans and followers of participating celebrities.</p>\n<h2><iframe src=\"//instagram.com/p/rznUCAgvgP/embed/\" width=\"612\" height=\"710\" frameborder=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"></iframe></h2>\n<h2>How did it start?</h2>\n<p>According to <a href=\"http://www.alsa.org/news/archive/ice-bucket-challenge.html\">ALSA&#8217;s news release on August 6th</a>, it was former Boston College baseball captain Pete Frates and his family who helped the movement go viral. Frates has worked tirelessly since his diagnosis to raise awareness about the disease.</p>\n<h2>Why did it go viral?</h2>\n<p>The campaign has all the elements necessary for social virality, it contained a simple message, a clear call-to-action, and was easily spreadable.</p>\n<h4>Simple</h4>\n<p>The #IceBucketChallenge is incredibly simple. All the ingredients needed for participation and readily available for most people: smartphone, a bucket, water, and social profiles.  Over <a href=\"http://www.gsmarena.com/asymco_pricing_doesnt_affect_smartphone_adoption_in_the_us-news-8982.php\">70% of Americans</a> who own a phone have a smartphone, which makes recording and sharing videos via social a breeze. North of the border, here in Canada, <a href=\"http://catalyst.ca/infographic-2014-canadian-smartphone-market/\">over 56% own smartphones</a> &#8211; which means the #IceBucketChallenge has millions of potential participants.</p>\n<h4>Clear</h4>\n<p>One difficulty that many non-profits have is how to articulate the proper call-to-action in an awareness campaign. Most of them end up focusing on raising money for a cause by asking for donations. The #IceBucketChallenge did this too, one half of their message asks for donations, the other asks for participation and raising awareness. It&#8217;s this later part that has been at the root of the campaign&#8217;s virality and one reason is the clear call-to-action for participants. <strong>You know what you&#8217;re supposed to do because the person who nominated you is showing you</strong>, just take a bucket of ice water and pour it over your head.</p>\n<h4>Spreadable</h4>\n<p>The nomination part was key to spreading the message exponentially. Every person nominates multiple people to take the ice bucket challenge, e.g. Mark Zuckerberg and Bill Gates nominated three people, Justin nominated a <a href=\"http://instagram.com/justinbieber\">potential 19 million</a>.</p>\n<p>See a playlist of the popular IceBucketChallenge videos done so far:</p>\n<p><iframe src=\"//www.youtube.com/embed/XS6ysDFTbLU\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"></iframe></p>\n', '<p>You must have spotted at least one still-frame of a celebrity getting drenched by a bucket of water in your Facebook newsfeed this weekend.

Steve E. had been working at a respectable Toronto accounting firm for more than 5 years, having a love &#8211; hate relationship with the industry, but trying valiantly to excel at his job and provide for his family. One of his clients at the accounting firm was an overseas based Tech Incubator. They mentioned that they were looking for more investors in one of their local offerings. Thinking outside the box, Steve proceeded to LinkedIN, where he located a few peers that were working for private family-run investment firms.  Using his stature, he was able to cold call and lure them into meetings where he was able to close upwards of $20 million in investment dollars.  Steve attributed this success to the simplicity in discovering <strong>who were his prime targets and which of those prime targets he was already connected to</strong>.</p>\n<p>In searching for material for this post, I found an amazing google+ post (see this <a href=\"http://www.leviait.com/1474\">post</a> regarding how google+ posts are now in Google search terms) by <a href=\"https://profiles.google.com/117357232755322984060\" rel=\"author\">Abhilash Prakash</a>  &#8211;  <a title=\"16 Jun 2011 03:17:56\" href=\"https://profiles.google.com/117357232755322984060/buzz/TVPvAztnwQy\" target=\"_blank\">16 Jun 2011</a>  &#8211;<br />\n&#8220;I regret for underestimating the power of Linkedin all these days and wasting my time on Facebook&#8230; Even an incomplete profile like mine on Linkedin does wonders for me 🙂<br />\nI am Flying :-)&#8221;</p>\n<p>While most people laud LinkedIn for its ability to further job creation in terms of looking for employment or employees, I wish to focus on its innate ability to further networking for leads/sales generation.  Though it is impossible to put a price tag on marketing/branding, I will easily admit that I personally have not seen any dollars from a LinkedIn connection.  Since I have not generated any dollars from LinkedIn, it is definitely not my place to explain how to do so.

So I headed to LinkedIN, searched for the culprit company and found out that I was connected to the Ceo of the Canadian operations.  I invited him to connect with me and proceeded to recount my tale in the 300 characters an invitation is alloted.   He never accepted my invitation, however I did receive an email shortly thereafter offering me a full year free.</p>\n<p>Whatever you actually use it for, LinkedIn will be become your most well connected friend.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://vimeo.com/21485474\">Welcome Back to Good Old Fashioned Networking and Deal Making via LinkedIn</a> from <a href=\"http://vimeo.com/mmlabs\">MMLabs</a> on <a href=\"http://vimeo.com\">Vimeo</a>.</p>\n', '<p>Linkedin has been a part of my vocabulary really since its launch.  While I have been striving to build my online business networking world for years, it has only been recently that I have started to see its power and success.  The impetus to write this post actually came about through an incident I recently heard [&hellip;]</p>\n', 3028, '2019-04-11 02:14:21', '2019-04-26 01:14:37', '2019-04-26 01:14:37'),

When you shop online and are told you are getting a 100% coupon, and then on the last step of checkout are asked for Credit card details, it sure looks suspicious, and could turn away a lot of customers.</p>\n<h4>Replacing the credit card payment method</h4>\n<p>The solution to that is to tell Ubercart that when order total is less then one cent, there is a different payment method that is to replace the credit card method. This is where this module comes in. Here is how the module creator summarized it:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<div>“The UC Free Order Payment Method module works in conjunction with the payment checkout pane using the order total preview to present a “Free order” payment method to customers when their order total drops to $0.00 or less. By default, this method will be hidden with Javascript and displayed only when appropriate. Server side verification of an order total on checkout form submission is used to prevent customers from gaming the system.”</div>\n</blockquote>\n<div></div>\n<p>And it does work great, except when you have a recurring item in the cart, at which point Ubercart acts confused, on one side it has the free order method saying that since you have a $0 order you should use the “free payment method”, on the other end is the recurring payment module saying since this order has recurring product, you should use one of the payment methods (like paypal wps) that support recurring billing. The solution we came up with was to extend the free payment method to support the recurring billing.</p>\n<p>The developers who worked on this are:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>David Adler from <a title=\"binahsoft\" href=\"http://www.binahsoft.com/\">www.binahsoft.com</a></li>\n<li>Nathan Bomshteyn from <a title=\"bomshteyn.com\" href=\"http://bomshteyn.com/\">bomshteyn.com</a></li>\n</ul>\n', '<p>In working on a recent project we encountered a problem.

You probably noticed though, that my blog runs on <a title=\"WordPress\" href=\"http://wordpress.org/\" rel=\"homepage\">WordPress</a>. I know someone will point it out to me and ask me why, and I got this question today from a friend of mine. So I decided to write a blog post about the general difference between WordPress and Drupal, and when you should choose one or the other.</p>\n<p>Let&#8217;s start with an excerpt from the WordPress.org site:</p>\n<blockquote><p>WordPress started as just a blogging systems, but has evolved to be used as full <a title=\"Content management system\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Content_management_system\" rel=\"wikipedia\">content management system</a> and so much more through the <a href=\"http://wordpress.org/extend/\">thousands of plug-ins, widgets, and themes</a>, WordPress is limited only by your imagination. (And tech chops.)</p></blockquote>\n<p>Now my thoughts based on experience and observation:</p>\n<p><!--more--></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://wordpress.com/\">WordPress</a> is an excellent system to use when creating a <a title=\"Website\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Website\" rel=\"wikipedia\">website</a> that lets you quickly get your thoughts out on the web, but while it is often used as a blog, it can be configured to work in many other interesting ways as well. I have used it several times with clients that are brand new to the Internet and having a website, yet they can pick this system up and use it quicker than the other two (<a href=\"https://www.drupal.org/\">Drupal</a> or <a title=\"Joomla\" href=\"http://www.joomla.org/\" rel=\"homepage\">Joomla</a>). Since WordPress is already developed to work as a blog, though, it can be set up to do so without much trouble. Comments are already built into the system, as well as pinging services, multiple blogger profiles, track-backs and more. Most of the time nothing needs to be done to those systems either, because they already work the way that the user would want them to.</p>\n<h3>WordPress, however, is not to be used for everything.</h3>\n<p>While I know there are e-commerce sites powered by WordPress, people have had little success (it&#8217;s there, just not much) using WordPress as a shopping cart. The reason that WordPress was created, was to put the keys of starting your own websites in everyone&#8217;s hands, take for instance their famed <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ell0SiTZyX8\">five-minute install</a>. But by doing it they stripped it to the bare minimum, which in turn now stops people from wanting to customize it to do more advanced things. It is supposed to be used as built, out of the box, because any modification that you give to it may very well cause it to break. You will find many users of WordPress complaining that it is not developer-friendly and rightfully so. When WordPress releases new updates, sites have been known to disappear or lose previously made modifications.</p>\n<h3><strong>WordPress Pros:</strong></h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Simple to use – no need for modifications</li>\n<li>Excellent for blogging or sharing thoughts in a sequential manner</li>\n<li>Not need to be tech-savvy to use</li>\n</ul>\n<h3><strong>WordPress Cons:</strong></h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Not very developer-friendly</li>\n<li>The community seems to like to complain much more than the Drupal community</li>\n<li>Upgrades, while they are extremely easy to do, sometimes bring more bugs than fixes, and the more plugins you have the bigger the chance of it happening</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>When Drupal is a better fit for you</h3>\n<p>If you are the type of person who would rather hand-code the content of your pages than use a <a title=\"WYSIWYG\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WYSIWYG\" rel=\"wikipedia\">WYSIWYG</a> Editor, or if you enjoy tweaking the code that makes up the framework of a website, then Drupal is probably for you. This advanced content management system, sometimes more closely resembles a developer platform than a traditional CMS. It&#8217;s not to say that only developers can use the system though, but to say that they will feel more at home here than in the other two. Interestingly, being more developer-friendly does not automatically make it more <a title=\"Usability\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Usability\" rel=\"wikipedia\">user friendly</a> in fact the developer has to work hard to make it that way if they need the end-product to do so.</p>\n<p>There are dozens more functions that can be used to develop in Drupal than in WordPress. Every single node has its own set of commands and tags that can be placed elsewhere to manipulate the function of the site, and this makes for a very intense experience (whether or not you know what you are doing). For those that are not so developer-minded, this can be the trial of their lives, but for people who live in code well, they can literally get lost developing some very cool websites.</p>\n<h3>Why Drupal doesn&#8217;t always look that great</h3>\n<p>Now, Drupal websites can act and function in some pretty cool ways, but Drupal has the problem that it just doesn’t look that great (at least not without long hours of work…). I have seen very few websites built in Drupal that look and feel as good as they function. Not that they don’t exist they are just few compared to the other ones. And the problem is not that it&#8217;s not themable, take for example a site we made (in conjunction with <a href=\"http://u2r1media.com/\">U2R1media</a>) for <a href=\"http://amaravati.ca/\">Amaravati</a>, a gorgeous site but we spent probably almost twice the time on the theming as on functionality. So the problem is just the opposite its very theme-able and customizable, but out of the box it looks like a site back from nineties, and theming has an extremely steep learning curve. You can especially see this in the theme directory on the <a title=\"Drupal\" href=\"http://drupal.org/\">Drupal.org</a> website, where there are dozens of these themes built to prove the exact point I just made. It’s a shame really, because with all of the development advancements the software has, it would almost be perfect with a stronger usability and design interface. It has made huge improvements with the core 6.x but more is needed and according to what I have read and seen about Drupal core 7.x they are putting a lot of effort into this area, but we will have to wait until it’s first stable release is out and then some time until all the important modules have their stable releases out the door.</p>\n<h3><strong>Drupal Pros:</strong></h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Extremely developer-friendly.</li>\n<li>Strong community to help discern the dozens (hundreds) of functions, modules and patches available.</li>\n<li>Can be used to create some really awesome websites that can outperform a majority of other sites out there.</li>\n<li>Scales as no other system would</li>\n</ul>\n<h3><strong>Drupal Cons:</strong></h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Not very designer and user-friendly. It’s hard for someone with little code knowledge to make the leaps required to do the very cool things that Drupal is becoming known for.</li>\n<li>Themes for Drupal has been a huge case of fail (until recently). Probably because it has been developers, not designers, that are making the themes.</li>\n<li>Getting a Drupal website published could cost you more time, and thus more money, than WordPress website.</li>\n<li>While WordPress could be hosted on very cheap hosting, Drupal needs an access to a lot of RAM.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>A vote of confidence for Drupal</h3>\n<p>Drupal was all over the news a couple of month ago when <a title=\"The White House\" href=\"http://whitehouse.gov/\">WhiteHouse.gov</a> remade their website in Drupal, it was definitely a vote of confidence in Drupal’s security by a site thats one of the most targeted by hackers in the world. Now while WordPress was not chosen by the White House, it’s known that BlackBerry is considered a brand of secure communications, so much so that even the President of United States Barack Obama was permitted by his security team to have one, and when they recently remade their <a title=\"Inside BlackBerry Blog\" href=\"http://blogs.blackberry.com/\">Inside BlackBerry blog</a> they used WordPress. So as far as Security is concerned, i would say it should not be on top of your list if you create in either one of the systems.</p>\n<p>What do you consider to be the pros and cons of each system?

This often gives the family a greater degree of privacy.</p>\n<p>Single-family Semi-detached</p>\n<p>A semi-detached home is a single-family home that is joined on one side to another home. It can offer many of the advantages of a single-family detached home. It is often less expensive to buy and maintain.</p>\n<p>Duplex</p>\n<p>A duplex is a building containing two single-family homes, located one above the other. Sometimes, the owner lives in one unit and rents the other.</p>\n<p>Row House (Townhouse)</p>\n<p>Row houses (also called townhouses) are several similar single-family homes, side-by-side, joined by common walls. They can be freehold or condominiums. They offer less privacy than a single-family detached home, although each has a separate outdoor space. These homes can cost less to buy and maintain, although some are large, luxury units.</p>\n<p>Stacked Townhouse</p>\n<p>Stacked townhouses are usually two-storey homes. Two two-story homes are stacked one on top of the other. The buildings are usually attached in groups of four or more. Each unit has direct access from the outside.</p>\n<p>Apartment</p>\n<p>A self-contained unit in part of a building consisting of a room or set of rooms including kitchen and bathroom facilities.</p>\n<p><strong>Types of ownership&nbsp;</strong></p>\n<p>There are two forms of ownership.</p>\n<p>Freehold</p>\n<p>Freehold means that one person (or two, such as joint ownership by spouses) owns the land and house outright. There is no space co-owned or co-managed with owners of other units.</p>\n<p>Freehold owners can do what they want with their property — up to a point. They must obey municipal bylaws, subdivision agreements, building codes and federal and provincial laws, such as those protecting the environment.</p>\n<p>Detached and semi-detached homes, duplexes and townhouses are usually owned freehold.</p>\n<p>Condominium</p>\n<p>Condominium ownership means you own the unit you live in and share ownership rights for the common space of the building. Common space includes areas such as corridors, the grounds around the building, and facilities such as a swimming pool and recreation rooms. Condominium owners together control the common areas through an owners’ association. The association makes decisions about using and maintaining the common space.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Reference:&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.cmhc-schl.gc.ca/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">CMHC Website</a></p>\n', '<p>Know what you want in your house Before even start to look for your dream home, you might want to finalize your requirements.

Please hold it for few minutes more. We strong suggest to learn few things before you use the tool.</p>\n<p><strong>Down Payment:</strong></p>\n<p>This is the amount you have to pay upfront. The rule for minimum down payment has recently been changed. The minimum down payment for a house up to $500000 is 5% of price. If you want to purchase, anything more than $500000. Calculation is little different. The minimum down payment of first 500000 is 5% as previous.&nbsp;&nbsp; You have to give 10% of the remaining portion of the price as down payment. Let us give an example.</p>\n<p>Minimum down payment for $500,000 house is $25,000 (5% of home price)</p>\n<p>Minimum down payment for $600,000 house would be $35,000 (5% of the first $500000 + 10% of remaining $100,000)</p>\n<p><strong>Off course, you can get a mortgage with minimum down payment. But that will not be a&nbsp;<u>conventional mortgage</u>. You have to lend money from&nbsp;<u>high-ratio mortgage</u>, for which you have to pay a monthly insurance premium for your mortgage. &nbsp;However, you can avoid this extra premium if you give 20% or more as a down payment, which will qualify you for conventional mortgage.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Pay off or Amortization period</strong></p>\n<p>Amortization refers to the number of year you want to repay your loan. This is usually 25 years. The period can be shorter. In that case , you have to pay less interest and monthly installment would be higher.</p>\n<p><strong>Interest Rate</strong></p>\n<p>There are three types of interest rate: Fixed rate, variable rate and protected variable rate.</p>\n<p>Fixed rate: Rate of the interest is fixed for a term. Whatever the market situation, your interest rate is fixed. Fixed Rate is little higher than others</p>\n<p>Variable rate: Your interest would be fluctuated as per the market rate. This is more suitable, when you presume interest rate may drop.</p>\n<p>Protected variable rate: This is similar to variable rate. However, maximum rate is determined beforehand, which means your interest rate can not be more than certain predetermined rate.</p>\n<p><strong>Choice of interest rate can be very critical. It needs a lot of speculation and knowledge to take the decision</strong></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>What is the maximum money you can have from lender?</strong></p>\n<p>Two simple rules guide the whole process-</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Your total monthly housing cost (monthly mortgage payment for house + property tax + heating cost) should not be more than 32% of your gross monthly family income before taxes.</li>\n<li>Your total monthly loan payments (monthly housing loan payments + other monthly loan or credit card payments) should not be more than 40% of gross monthly family income before taxes.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Based on these two principles, bank determines two ration. Gross Debt Service (GDS) ratio and other one is Total Debt Service ratio.</p>\n<p><strong>GDS ratio</strong>&nbsp;is calculated simply dividing monthly total housing cost (monthly mortgage payment for house + property tax + heating cost) by monthly gross income of the family before taxes.</p>\n<p><strong>TDS ratio</strong>&nbsp;is calculated simply dividing total monthly entire debt load (monthly housing costs + other monthly loan or credit card payments) by gross monthly family income before taxes.</p>\n<p>Example: (you do not need to the calculation, use our&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.banglatoronto.ca/calculator\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">affordability calculator</a>, you will get the result automatically)</p>\n<p>Your monthly gross income = $5000</p>\n<p>Your spouse’s gross income = $3000</p>\n<p>Other sources of income (if any) = $2000</p>\n<p><strong>Your monthly gross family income= $10000</strong></p>\n<p>You are planning to buy a house of 500,000</p>\n<p>You are paying $ 25000 as down payment</p>\n<p>You need to borrow another $475000</p>\n<p>At an imaginary interest rate of 3.39 and for 25 years of repayment period, your monthly mortgage payments would be approximately $ 2350 (can be calculated from our<a href=\"http://www.banglatoronto.ca/calculator\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">&nbsp;affordability calculator</a>)</p>\n<p>At present rate of City of Toronto, your yearly residential property tax would be 0.7056% of property price. Your monthly property tax would be $294.</p>\n<p>Your heating cost would be approximately $150.</p>\n<p><strong>Your monthly housing cost would be $ (2350+294+150) or $ 2794</strong></p>\n<p>Your monthly payment of your personal loan = $100</p>\n<p>Your monthly student loan payment =$100</p>\n<p>Your monthly credit card payment =$100</p>\n<p><strong>Your monthly entire debt load = $ 2794 + $100 + $100 + $100 = $3094</strong></p>\n<p><strong>So your GDS ratio would be 0.2794 and TDS ration would be 0.3094.</strong></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong><u>To be eligible for loan, your GDS and TDS ratio should be lower than 0.32 and 0.40 respectively.

Plenty of parking available on the street (for free), 15 minutes drive to downtown (without traffic) and 45-55 minutes with TTC.\nThe basement is spacious (540 sq.ft), with 1 bedroom, a bathroom with a stand alone shower (ceiling height for the shower is a bit low, If you are taller than 5\' 10\" (178cm), would be a bit uncomfortable to shower). The kitchen does not have an oven/stove so if you are Gordon Ramsey this is not the place for you! There is a decent microwave, a toaster oven and a double burner but obviously this place is not for someone who likes to cook often. The laundry room is in the basement, I live upstairs and will be sharing the laundry room with the tenant in the basement. You can use the washer and dryer and I will only be using it once a week on Sunday mornings. I am looking for one to two people short or long term.
